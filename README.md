# BMICalculator
Created a program that can caluclate your BMI with just a couple inputs. 

This was done using 2 inputs and knowledge of variable types. 

  print("Welcome! Congratulations for taking your first step on your journey to better health")
  weight = input("Let's start by getting your weight\n")
  height = input("What is your height? Insert height in meters = 1.75\n")
  bmi = int(weight) / float(height) ** 2
  bmiFinal = int(bmi)
  print("Your BMI is " + str(bmiFinal))
